# Community Content - Azure Machine Learning

This folder contains content introducing Azure Machine Learning and demonstrating how to use it to build machine-learning models. The content is divided into two sessions:

- Session 1 - Slides
- Session 2 - Building Smart Apps with Azure Machine Learning (HOL)

The HOL comes in two versions — one that requires Windows 10 and Visual Studio, and one that works on any operating system — and may be presented as a hands-on lab or as a demo accompanying the slide deck.
